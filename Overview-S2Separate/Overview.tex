\begin{tutorial}

{\bf Aim of Course}  \\
To develop foundational statistical literacy which can be transferred to any discipline: \\
how to understand data (Part1), how data arises from populations (Part2), and how to use data to test hypotheses and make inferences about the population (Part3).  \\ \\

{\bf Quiz Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Please bring your student card for identification.  \\ 
\item Quizzes are completed in the first 20 minutes of your designated tutorial class.  \\ 
\item Quizzes are completed online, using a link on the MATH1005 website.  \\ 
\item Each Quiz consist of 5 short questions requiring a numerical answer. \\
\item If the answer requires rounding, use up to 2dp.  \\
\item Use both hand working and R to doublecheck your calculations. \\ 
\item You may use a calculator and refer to the MATH1005 website but not have any hard copies of notes.  \\
\item To prepare, work through the practise questions and revise the relevant lectures and tutes. \\
\item The better mark principle automatically applies to the Quizzes. 
\end{itemize}

{\bf Stats Reports} \\
The Stats Reports test statistical literacy and communication.   \\

to your tute class. & $\bullet$ Submit PDF of Written Report through Turnitin    \\
&     \\
Report1 is designed to give you experience with    & Week4: Present Verbal Report in Tute class.       \\ 
analysing data of your choice to illustrate the    &      \\ 
transfer of Statistics to any discipline. &   \\
&      \\  [2ex]  \hline 
 & \\

  & \\   [2ex]   \hline 
\end{tabular} }

The better mark principle does not apply to the Reports. \\

\newpage
{\bf Report1 Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Collaboration} \\
Decide whether you are going to do the report alone or with someone in your tutorial class. Working as a pair helps to develop the skill of collaboration and usually improves the result. \\
\item {\bf Source Data} \\
Find a data set that you are interested in, ideally something related to your major or potential career.   Often a larger data set is more interesting, but dealing with small data sets is also an important skill. This can take many hours. It usually helps to search by the subject (eg Breast Cancer) and file type (eg .csv). \\
\item {\bf Import your Data into R} \\
See the Intro Tute for different methods. You must use R for your analysis. \\
\item {\bf Do Exploratory Data Analysis} \\
Using the techniques in Topics1-3, extract variables you are interested in, and explore your data. \\
\item {\bf Fill out Template (Written Report)} \\
Fill out the Template. Then attach your RCode (commands) and Data as pages 2 and 3. Save the whole file as a PDF. Name the file by the subject (eg BreastCancer.pdf). You will lose a mark for not using the Template and for going over the 1 page limit. \\

\noindent
Page1: Template (including relevant R output) \\
Page2: RCode (Commands) \\
Page3: Data \\

\item {\bf Produce a presentation (Verbal Report)} \\
Using your Written report as a guide, produce slides for presentation to your tutorial class. The content of the Verbal Report does not have to be the same as the Written Report - choose whatever is interesting for your class. Save the file as a PDF. Name the file by the subject (eg BreastCancerPresentation.pdf). \\
\item {\bf Submit both PDFs in Turnitin} \\
Submit your PDFs in Turnitin, using the file title as the Turnitin title. If you work as a pair, both students need to individually submit the same PDFs of the Verbal and Written Reports through Turnitin. No other form of documents (eg .docx, .pptx) will be marked. \\

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{TurnitinSubmission.png}
\end{center}

\item {\bf Present in your class} \\
Your tutor will access your presentation file in Turnitin and put it on the big screen. You cannot bring your file on a USB. The Verbal Report is 2 mins long (with strict maximum of 2.5 mins). If the Verbal Report is presented as a pair, then both students must be part of the presentation (whether speaking or operating the slides).  \\

\noindent
{Marking Scheme for Verbal Report} \\
1 mark: Student(s) presents the Report with PDF. \\
1 mark: Student(s) explains an appropriate presentation of the data. \\
1 mark: Student(s) explain the motivation for the Report (eg impact or usefulness).
